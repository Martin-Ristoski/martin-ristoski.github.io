  <p class="hobbies-text-long">
      Through my life I've tried many hobbies. In some I was good, but in some I was trash. I stuck with the ones that
      I was good in, like my main hobby-cycling. My main discipline is Mountain Biking, but also do some Road Cycling
      on the side. Sometimes I record my rides, and when I do, I make a short video of it with some editing magic.
      I didn't know how to edit, but with some help from YouTube I learnt to do, and before I knew it, it turned into
      a hobby. You can check my latest cycling video
      <a class="big-text text-d" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoJAX4o8LN4&ab_channel=MartinRistoski" target="_blank">here</a>.
      As I wanted to stay in shape in the winter when I couldn't ride, I got into running and now i occasionally run
      when I am bored with the bike.
