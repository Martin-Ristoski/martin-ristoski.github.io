            <p>I am a first year student at the Faculty of Software Engineering and
                Computer Sciences (FINKI). I have graduated from SUGS "Orce Nikolov." <br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <h2>Few Words About Me: <br></h2>
                If you ever want to spark a conversation with me, you just have to say something
                about bikes. As you can probably guess, my hobby is riding bikes. I have been riding bikes (as a hobby)
                for nearly 4 years now. My main discipline is Mountain Biking, but also do some Road Cycling
                on the side. When I record my rides, I make a short video of it with some editing magic.
                You can check my latest YouTube video
