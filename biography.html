            <p class="two2">
                I was born in 2002 in Tetovo, where I have lived my whole life.
                I was a shy, but friendly child, having many friends and spending a good part of my day outside.
                I finished middle school in OU "Bratstvo Migjeni" in Tetovo and after finishing,
                I seeked a better education in Skopje.

                Teenage Years:
            </h2>
            <p class="three3">I ended up choosing SUGS "Orce Nikolov" as my high school, where I graduated in 2021.
                As I was from a different city, my teens were filled with different, unknown people, so I can freely say
                that it made me get out of my comfort zone and meet new people from which I learnt a lot and upgraded
                as a person soaking a bit of knowledge from everyone. In those four years I tried many
                <a id="a" href="hobbies.html">hobbies</a>, but found myself the most in cycling. After graduating from
                high school, I chose the Faculty of Software Engineering and Computer Sciences (FINKI) as my college
                where I am currently studying.
